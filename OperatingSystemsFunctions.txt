One of the many functions of an operating system is memory management. The operating systerm tracks and reports how much memory is given or alocated to each process. The operating system also tracks whenever memoery is freed or no longer being used by a prevously alocated process, and then updates to the new status.
Another vital function of an operating system is device management. The operating system manages all hardware devices (boh input and output devices) conected or attempting connection to the device. The operating system will keep a very up to date status of each device and whether or not that device is free of busy. Operating systems use controllers to make this process easier, faster, and more efficient.
The aspect of the operating system that is the easiest to see is the user interface. Without the user interface there is no effective way for a person to interact with the computer system. This is the portion of the operating system that is taylored to the users in addition to efficiency, as in the visual, audible, and in some devices touch interaction are handled by this process so its pretty vital to users.
