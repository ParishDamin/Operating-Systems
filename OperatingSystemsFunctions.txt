One of the many functions of an operating system is memory management. The operating systerm tracks and reports how much memory is given or alocated to each process. The operating system also tracks whenever memoery is freed or no longer being used by a prevously alocated process, and then updates to the new status.
Another vital function of an operating system is device management. The operating system manages all hardware devices (boh input and output devices) conected or attempting connection to the device. The operating system will keep a very up to date status of each device and whether or not that device is free of busy. Operating systems use controllers to make this process easier, faster, and more efficient.
